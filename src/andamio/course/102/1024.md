## Introduction
Locking tokens in a contract address is very similar to sending a transaction to any wallet address, with one key difference: When sending a transaction to a contract address, we must include "datum" in the tx-out.

In this introduction to smart contract transactions, we will lock some tokens at an Always Succeeds contract address.

 # How to lock tokens at a contract address

## A Contract UTxO Must Include Datum
Datum is information included in a UTxO. When you `query utxo` for an address with `cardano-cli`, you can see whether each UTxO has a datum. Watch the video above to see how.

You will use datum in a variety of ways throughout this course. But, for now, watch the video above for a quick overview, and look at the `transaction build` below to see how to include datum in a `tx-out`.


## Which Always Succeeds will you use?
- Before you build a locking Tx, decide which "Always Succeeds" contract to use. You can use any of the [Always Succeeds contracts built in Module 101, as summarized here](/modules/101/summary).
- After you decide which Always Succeeds scripts to use, build the address for that Plutus script, as shown in [Lessson 102.2](/modules/102/1022).


## Set Variables:
```bash
SENDER_ADDRESS=
SENDER_KEY=
UTXO_IN=
LOVELACE_TO_LOCK=
```

### For Reference - Always Succeeds Addresses:
```bash
ALWAYS_SUCCEEDS_ADDRESS_PLUTUSTX=addr_test1wqag3rt979nep9g2wtdwu8mr4gz6m4kjdpp5zp705km8wys6t2kla
ALWAYS_SUCCEEDS_ADDRESS_AIKEN=addr_test1wzd7s978pzla9qdwjshnme9wvlwfrrajzwcztpay7uynx9qalqts7
ALWAYS_SUCCEEDS_ADDRESS_PLU_TS=addr_test1wr5vjne65nh3zfp9ndf6xnk02uxkzlsdtczsu7pxw8gatuqzdca8z
```

### How to Query a Contract Address:
```bash
cardano-cli query utxo --testnet-magic 1 --address $ALWAYS_SUCCEEDS_ADDRESS_PLUTUSTX
```


## Build, Sign and Submit Transaction:
```bash
cardano-cli transaction build \
--babbage-era \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-in $UTXO_IN \
--tx-out $ALWAYS_SUCCEEDS_ADDRESS_PLUTUSTX+$LOVELACE_TO_LOCK \
--tx-out-inline-datum-value 1618 \
--change-address $SENDER_ADDRESS \
--out-file lock-always-succeeds.raw

cardano-cli transaction sign \
--signing-key-file $SENDER_KEY \
--testnet-magic 1 \
--tx-body-file lock-always-succeeds.raw \
--out-file lock-always-succeeds.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file lock-always-succeeds.signed \
--testnet-magic 1
```

In Lesson 102.5, you will learn how to unlock tokens from the Always Succeeds contract address.
