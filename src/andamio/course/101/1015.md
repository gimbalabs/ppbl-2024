## Introduction

Aiken is a new language for developing smart contracts on Cardano. If you have a background in Rust development, you might find yourself at home with Aiken.The Aiken language was written in Rust, but Aiken is not Rust. When we use Aiken, we will use some Rust tooling.To get started, watch this video or follow along with the documentation below.

## Links
- [Aiken Programming Language](https://aiken-lang.org/)
- [The Aiken documentation is helpful. We recommend taking a look!](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/getting-started)

## You Will Know YOu Are Successful If:
You can see a "plutus.json" file after running "aiken build". Review the video above, or follow along with the documentation below. If you get stuck, ask for help at Live Coding or on Gimbalabs Discord.

Updated 2023-06-01

## Step by Step
To get started with Aiken, we will follow the [Hello World tutorial in the official Aiken documentation](https://aiken-lang.org/example--hello-world)

### Step 1: Install Rust
- To install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and the [Cargo package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [follow the official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
- If you want to learn more about Rust, the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) is very good.

You will know you are successful if you can run `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`:
```bash
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.69.0 (84c898d65 2023-04-16)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.69.0 (6e9a83356 2023-04-12)
```

### Step 2: Install Aiken
- Review the [Aiken documentation](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions)
- Installs globally
Aiken will be installed globally, which means that you can use it from anywhere on your computer.

You will know you are successful if you can run `aiken -V`:
```bash
$ aiken -V
aiken 1.0.6-alpha
```

### Step 3: Follow Aiken Hello World tutorial

#### Step 4: Simplify the Validator to make it Always Succeeds!
Instead of writing `hello_world.ak`, we can write an even simpler validator called `always_succeeds.ak`:
```rust
validator {
  fn always_succeed(_datum: Data, _redeemer: Data, _context: Data) -> Bool {
    True
 }
}
```

After you write `always_succeeds.ak`, run `aiken build` and look at the resulting `plutus.json` file.

### Step 5 (Optional): Try to clear the warnings
If you follow along with the video above or the steps listed here, you should end up with some warnings after running `aiken build`. To learn more about how Aiken works, read each of these warnings. Try to eliminate all of them, and run `aiken build` again.

## Notes:


### In Aiken, the output is a `.json` file
- This represents cutting-edge work in Cardano development
- A standard "contract blueprint" will allow developers to build interoperable tooling - just like they did for Cardano NFTs!
- To learn more, [read CIP 57](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/KtorZ/CIP-0054/plutus-contract-blueprint/CIP-0057). We will investigate this [Cardano Improvement Proposal and others](https://cips.cardano.org/) throughout PPBL 2023.
