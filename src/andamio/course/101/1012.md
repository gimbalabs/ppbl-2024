## Introduction

There is some debate over whether the term "smart contract" is really the best way to describe the code we use on a blockchain. On Cardano, we use the word "validator".", A validator defines the rules for unlocking tokens from a Cardano address. In this module, you will see how to compile validators to UPLC. This should raise a new question: after you compile a smart contract to Plutus Core, what can you do with it? Keep this question in mind. We will continue to ask it throughout the course.Watch this video to see one way to think about the role of validators and UPLC in a decentralized application.

## You Will Know YOu Are Successful If:
You can explain how Plutus scripts are used in a Cardano application. At the end of this module, you will have your first compiled Plutus scripts. Then, in Modules 102 and 201 you will start to use them.
