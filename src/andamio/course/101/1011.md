In this course, you will learn how to write smart contracts that can be used on the Cardano blockchain. In this module, we will take our first look at some of the smart contract languages on Cardano. All of these languages share some basic design patterns, even though each language looks a little different. All of these langauges compile to Untyped Plutus Core (UPLC). UPLC can be encoded in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), and this CBOR can be used on the blockchain. To see what this CBOR looks like, watch this video.

## You Will Know You Are Successful If
You can compile a contract to UPLC from the language of your choice. To master this learning target, you must attempt at least one of the approaches suggested in Lessons 101.3 through 101.7. Are you ready? If so, move on to Lesson 2.
