# Module 201 Summary

## Learning Target Review


## What are your biggest questions about each of these learning targets?

<SLTSmall moduleNumber={201} id={'201.1'} />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={201} id={'201.2'} />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={201} id={'201.3'} />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={201} id={'201.4'} />
<SLTSmall moduleNumber={201} id={'201.5'} />


## Key Idea: Keep Learning

- Now that you have seen a little bit of React, TypeScript, Mesh, GraphQL and Koios, what are you most excited about?
- The Cardano development ecosystem needs experts in all of the above.
- When you go deeper with each of these tools, you will encounter the problems + opportunities at the frontiers of Cardano development.
- Together, we'll have chances to practice everything that was introduced in this module as we continue to build.

### What is one thing you will explore more deeply in the next few weeks?

export default ({ children}) => <MDXLessonLayout>{children}</MDXLessonLayout>
