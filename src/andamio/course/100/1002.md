To make it easy for developers to build and test applications on Cardano, IOHK provides [Testnet Faucets](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet) within the[Cardano Ecosystem documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/).

Watch this video to see how to get test-Ada, or "tAda" on the Prepod testnet, or follow the steps below.

1. Go to [https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet)
2. Make sure to select "Preprod Testnet" from the Environment menu.
3. Enter your Preprod address and submit the form.
4. Wait a few moments for your "tAda" to arrive. Then refresh this page and connect your wallet again.
