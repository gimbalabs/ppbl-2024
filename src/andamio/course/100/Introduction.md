## Welcome to Plutus PBL 2023!

The purpose of this module is to give you an example of how this course works.

PBL stands for Project-Based Learning. Projects allow us to learn by doing.

Every Module in PPBL starts with a list of Student Learning Targets (SLTs), as shown above.

In this module, you will start to see some different ways to think about ”Mastery” of each SLT.

At the top of the page there is a status bar that corresponds to these SLTs. You will see how this works in Lesson 1.

We will continue to show you around in the next few lessons.

For now, use the sidebar to navigate to Lesson 1, or tap the button below.
