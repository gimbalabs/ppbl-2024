Usually, when we talk about Cardano, we are talking about the "Cardano Mainnet".

But Mainnet is not the only Cardano network.

We would not want to test new decentralized applications on the Cardano Mainnet: if we made a mistake, we could lose
tokens that have a real value!
That'&rsquo;'s why in this course we will use Cardano'&rsquo;'s "pre-production test network" also known as "Preprod".

### Your Task
Your first task in PPBL 2023 is to connect a browser-based wallet to Preprod.

- Make sure that you have a browser wallet like [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/) or [Eternl](https://eternl.io/) installed.
- Review the short video above to see how to connect your wallet to Preprod.
- Use the Connect Wallet button below to see if you are successful!

Try to connect a wallet. Make sure it is on Cardano Pre-Production test network.

Todo: Build a success component here.
