## Intro

We think it's wonderful that this PPBL course can tell you that you've mastered the first two SLTs. But "Mastery" cannot always be measured directly.

Blockchains require all of us to be careful keeping custody of private keys and mnemonic phrases, and you are the most important judge of whether or not you have mastered this learning target.

Join us for a conversation about wallet security at [Plutus PBL Live Coding](/live-coding) on Thursday, 2023-03-16 at 1430 UTC. This session will be recorded and posted to this lesson page.


## Assignment

When building on Cardano, there are a few different ways you will handle your keys.

For now, just make sure that your mnemonic words are written off-line, and that you have more than one secure copy.

In Module 101, we will discuss key management on cardano-cli. In Module 201, we will investigate how keys can be stored in web applications, and you will learn how to hack Lesson 100.4.

## You Will Know You Are Successful If:
You are confident that no one else can access your keys.
