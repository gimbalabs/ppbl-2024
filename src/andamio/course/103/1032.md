## Introduction
Any time you use existing code or contribute to a project, you are building upon the work of other people. The more you understand how and why existing tools are built, the better you will be able to re-use those tools in new and exciting applications. At the heart of open source development is collaborative support - helping other people to become contributors to a project. Writing new code is not the only way to contribute to existing projects. You can contribute by writing documentation, which is essential for onboarding new contributors. You can create demonstrations or use-cases for existing code, which helps people have new ideas for how to use these new tools.

 # Re-using Code

Developers re-use existing code all the time. Here are some examples:
- Any time we install packages with a package manager.
- When we are collaborating on a team, we are building on the work of our teammates.
- When we read documentation or a code repository, and copy/paste blocks of code.
- When we ask an AI chatbot to help us write some code.


## When you re-use code:
1. **Make sure you know how to use it.** Of course you can copy and paste any time. Even if you would not be able to write it, try to understand how the code works. This is always true - and perhaps even more important when you are re-using smart contract code.
2. **Check the license.** Make sure you're allowed to use the code.
3. **Try to contribute.** If you like [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) or [plu-ts](https://pluts.harmoniclabs.tech/), [Mesh](https://meshjs.dev/) or [Lucid](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid), [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/) or this Plutus PBL course, all of these builders are accessible. Go say thanks. Go ask what you can do to help. Write a bit of documentation.


## When you install a package, you are re-using code.
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/package-management/package-management.html),  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are all package managers.
- When you install a package using any of these tools, you are re-using code.

### For Example
In the PPBL2023 Plutus Template, in the file [ppbl2023-plutus-template.cabal](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/ppbl-2023/ppbl2023-plutus-template/-/blob/main/ppbl2023-plutus-template.cabal), there is a list of `build-depends` that looks like this:
```cabal
  build-depends:      base ^>=4.14.3.0
                    , aeson
                    , bytestring
                    , containers
                    , cardano-api
                    , data-default
                    , plutus-ledger-api
                    , plutus-tx-plugin
                    , plutus-tx
                    , text
                    , serialise
                    , plutus-core
                    , tagged
                    , prettyprinter
                    , cardano-api
```

Each of these build dependencies is a package that was written by other developers.

In Module 201, we will build a simple front-end for interacting with Cardano. We will start by installing a set of packages that will be used to an application.


## Test Yourself with AI Code Generation
Here's a cool test that you can run any time.

### Step by Step:
1. Ask Chat GPT or GitHub Copilot how to write some code.
2. Can you tell if the response is correct or not?


## What does this test tell you about your mastery of SLT 103.2?
